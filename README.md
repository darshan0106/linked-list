# Linked List Implementation in Python
**Introduction**

A linked list is a linear data structure in which elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. Each element, or node, contains a data part and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence. This implementation provides basic operations for a singly linked list.

**Explanation**

1) Node Class:

* init: Initializes a node with data and a reference to the next node.

2) LinkedList Class:

* init: Initializes an empty linked list with the head set to None.

* insert_at_beginning: Inserts a node at the beginning of the list.

* insert_at_end: Inserts a node at the end of the list.

* insert_values: Inserts multiple values into the list by clearing the current list and appending each value to the end.

* length: Returns the length (number of nodes) of the list.

* remove_at: Removes the node at the specified index.

* insert_at: Inserts a node at the specified index.

* print: Prints the elements of the list.

3) Main Execution:

* Creates an instance of the LinkedList class.
* Inserts multiple values into the list.
* Prints the length of the list.
* Prints the list before and after removing and inserting elements at specific positions.

**Usage**
* Run the code.
* The program will perform a series of operations on the linked list and print the results to the console.
